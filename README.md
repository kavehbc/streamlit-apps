This repo contains few apps/games developed in Streamlit.

## Guessing Game

> Project Location: `apps/guess/main.py`

This project takes a maximum number from the user. Then it chooses a random number between 1 and the given maximum number.
Now, it is the user's turn to guess the selected random number. By each try, app would hint if its number is higher or lower.
One the number is guessed correctly, it would tell how many times it has been tried.
